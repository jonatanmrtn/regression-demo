# regression-demo
In this regression model demo, we try to fit the best model to fit the data coming from a misterious dataset.

There are 4 subfolders with the following contents:

 - data: contains a tar.gz file which contain the data used during the challenge.
 - src: contains source code
 - notebooks: contains the jupyter notebook files necessary to perform the analysis. You can run them in Jupyter or Visual Studio Code
 - results: contains a CSV with the results from the blind test dataset
